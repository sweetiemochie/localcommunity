<h2 style="text-align: center;" > TASEK TIMAH TASOH LAKE </h2>
<div class="info-box-container">
    <div class="info-box">
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Lake Timah Tasoh, located in Perlis, is a man-made reservoir with 
    a name derived from the rivers Sungai Timah and Sungai Tasoh.
     Constructed in 1987, it serves as a water catchment area and offers
      beautiful views of the surrounding greenery and hills. The lake is a
       serene retreat, offering a peaceful escape from city life. The area is
        home to hundreds of migratory birds, which flock during the winter season 
        in the northern hemisphere. The International Bird Life has declared the 
        lake an important area for bird and biological diversity, with 135 to 145
         species recorded. The best time to spot migratory birds is from October to March.

    Located 17 km from Kangar, the capital of Perlis, visitors can explore the lake 
    by binoculars, fishing, participating in group retreats, courses, and seminars, 
    taking in the sunrise views, and savoring the Harumanis mango, a unique variety 
    found in the state. The sounds of insects and birds create a mini orchestra of nature,
     making Lake Timah Tasoh an ideal destination for nature lovers.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;" > TASIK MELATI </h2>
<div class="info-box-container">
<div class="info-box">
  <p style="text-align: justify;" > Tasik Melati is a charming little lake with shallow waters, 
    adorned by over 150 sandbars scattered throughout its expanse. To enhance visitors' enjoyment
     of the picturesque scenery, a boardwalk has been constructed along the lake, providing resting 
     spots along the way.

    Nestled in the northern region of Kangar, Perlis, Malaysia, Tasik Melati may be small in size but 
    is undoubtedly beautiful. Its name, "Melati Lake," is derived from the floating lotus blossoms adorning its surface.
    
    This man-made lake has become a favorite spot for picnics among locals and offers a tranquil setting
     for relaxation and contemplation.</p>
