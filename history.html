                        <p class="description">Timah Tasoh Lake is a man-made reservoir in Perlis, Malaysia, covering an area of 1,300 hectares. It was constructed between 1987 and 1992 to serve as a water catchment area for the surrounding areas, improve the irrigation system of paddy fields, supply water to the people of the state, and prevent floods in Perlis. The lake's name is derived from the two rivers that flow into it, Sungai Timah and Sungai Tasoh. It has been declared an important area for birds and biological diversity, with a bird sanctuary set up to protect the habitat of migratory birds. The lake is also a suitable site for fish breeding and other aquaculture. . The lake was formed by damming the Timah River and Tasoh River, and it is very important for agricultural growth in Perlis, particularly for paddy plantation. The lake's existence led to the submergence of a village named Tasoh, along with its mosque, houses, school, and graveyard</p>
